# Game to create a number system and test its logic

This is a simple program to:

* create a number system using a set of characters selected by the user
* let users test their ability to convert numbers to their number system

## Components

The program was developed using TDD in the conversion logic. So far is made out of three components:

* the conversion logic
* the application
* tests on the conversion logic (using pytest as a test runner)
